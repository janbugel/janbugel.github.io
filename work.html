        <h1>Zero to production in one week. No-code inventory management with barcode scanning </h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            As an intern at local 3d printing company, I was tasked to improve their inventory management of plastic filament spools,
            which are used to print 3d models. The comapny has a relatively large inventory of spools, and they needed a way to track
            the number of spools in stock - how many are coming in - and how many were spent - so they would know when to order new ones 
            (ideally they would get notification, something like: there are less than 10 spools of material: pla, color: black, order now). 
            They also wanted to be able to quickly add new spools with barcode scanner, update inventory in case someone didnt use barcode
             and also scan barcode on the spool was used up. Another requirement was that employees needed to use smartphone app to scan the 
             spools for ease of use. 
            This app would have to communicate with google sheets or microsoft 
            excel since that is what the business owners are already using to track their inventory, business expenses, customer 
            lists ect.</p>

        <h2>Choosing the Platform: Google AppSheet</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Another thing to mention is that there were previous interns at this company that were studying computer science that were tasked
            to do this app. But it was taking too long and they were asking too much money so the company asked me if I can do it faster and 
            for cheaper. So development speed was numero uno requirement for what platforms to use. Naturally, during my research I gravitated
            towards no-code platforms for this reason. After some time spend on research, I decided to use AppSheet due to couple reasons. It
            was free at a time and there were lot of templates that people created and shared publicly I could use them as a starting point.</p>
