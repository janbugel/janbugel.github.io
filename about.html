        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have several years of experience in web development and specialize in front-end technologies.
        I mostly work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I also have experience with Node.js and MySQL.
        I create educational content for developers, teaching them about web development, JavaScript and TypeScript, 
        React and Next.js, and more. This comes in all forms: blog posts, videos, tweets, conference talks, and workshops. You can watch some of my favorites below.
